# Sports-Logos-Game

## Approach:

I wanted to take care of the functionality first, make sure it works and then tackle the CSS. And I think that was a sound approach for me, because I could see myself going back and forth between the functionality and the css so often to the point where it'd slow me down. I also wanted to set my game up dynamically through jQuery, while creating as few elements in my HTML file as possible. Making two HTML files crossed my mind, but I chose to set it up similar to a homework assignment we did with the racers, and change the background and hide some elements from the landing page instead. 


## Functionality: 

On the landing page, the "How To Play" button displays a modal with the instructions. Once the user clicks the "Wanna Play?" button, he/she is taken to the game page where everything happens. Click "Begin", and the timer gets set to 45 seconds and the first logo pops up. From there, you have 45 seconds to get as many correct answers as possible out of 20. The score card in the top right box keeps track of where you are in the game. If you get all 20, you win. If not, an alert pops up booing you. The order of the logos and the order of each logo's multiple choice options are randomized. 

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript/jQuery

## Unsolved Problems: 

My reset button that takes the user back to the landing page is a bit wonky. I think it would've been easier to pull off if I had used two HTML files. Also, making the timer showing up is a bit delayed.
