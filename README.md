# Sports Logos Trivia Game

## Functionality: 

On the landing page, the "How To Play" button displays a modal with the instructions. Once the user clicks the "Wanna Play?" button, he/she is taken to the game page where everything happens. Click "Begin", and the timer gets set to 45 seconds and the first logo pops up. From there, you have 45 seconds to get as many correct answers as possible out of 20. The score card in the top right box keeps track of where you are in the game. If you get all 20, you win. If not, an alert pops up booing you. The order of the logos and the order of each logo's multiple choice options are randomized.
